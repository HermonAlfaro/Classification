# Classifications

I am doing the course Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science of Udemy.
I will use this repository to upload the scripts based in the course, but written by the OOP programming.
I will be changing and improving the code to do it the most generally possible and with more classification metrics.
